1.  double (double 2)
    double (2 + 2)
    (2 + 2) + (2 + 2)
    4 + 4
    8

2.  sum [x]
    sum (x:[])
    x + sum []
    x + 0
    x

3.  product [] = 1
    product (x:xs) = x * product xs

    product [2,3,4]
    product (2:[3,4])
    2 * product [3,4]
    2 * product (3:[4])
    2 * 3 * product [4]
    2 * 3 * product (4:[])
    2 * 3 * 4 * product []
    2 * 3 * 4 * 1
    24

4.  qsort [] = []
    qsort (x:xs) = qsort larger ++ [x] ++ qsort smaller
        where
            smaller = [a | a <- xs, a <= x]
            larger  = [b | b <- xs, b > x]

5.  Filters out duplicate entries while sorting
